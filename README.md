------------------changing node version ------------------
To list all installed versions of Node.js, you can use the following command:

```bash
nvm ls
```

This command will display all the versions of Node.js installed on your system managed by Node Version Manager (nvm).

To switch to Node.js version 20.11.1, you can use the following command:

```bash
nvm use 20.11.1
```

This command will activate the specified Node.js version (20.11.1 in this case) and set it as the currently active version.
