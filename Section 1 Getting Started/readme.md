Creating React Native Projects
In the next lecture, we'll create our first React Native app. We'll do that with help of a tool called "Expo".

The command you should execute in order to create a new app changed though - instead of expo init (as shown in the next lecture), you should now use npx create-expo-app.

But that's it - the rest stays the way it is, the other instructions given in the course still apply. :)
